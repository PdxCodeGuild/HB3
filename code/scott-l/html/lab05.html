   <!-- Intro to Flask  Lab 05

Implement ONE of the following Python labs in a Flask app:

    Rot Cipher
        Simple version: the user could just input the word to encode.
        Complex version: the user could also input the amount to rotate by.
    Unit Converter
        Simple version: the user enters the distance and units and the app shows them the converted distance in meters
        Complex version: the user also enters output units
    Random Password Generator
        Simple version: the user just enters in the number of characters in the password
        Complex version: the user enters the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters -->
