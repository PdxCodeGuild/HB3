   <!-- Lab 7: Personal Portfolio -->
   <!-- A personal portfolio website helps market yourself to 
   prospective employers and can demonstrate your skills 
   as a front-end developer. GitHub lets you host a static 
   website for free, and since we're hosting our code there 
   already, it's a great place for a personal portfolio site. 
   Follow this tutorial to create your own site. Here's a 
   thorough guide for developing a portfolio site. You can
    also get a custom domain from a number of domain registrars 
    3(Google, Hover, etc) and then follow this tutorial for 
    setting it up with GitHub Pages. -->
