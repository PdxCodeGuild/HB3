    <h1>Jan Vermeer</h1>

    <center><p>Dutch artist who created paintings that are among the most beloved and revered images in the history of art.
        Although only about 36 of his paintings survive, these rare works are among the greatest treasures in the world’s finest museums.
        Vermeer began his career in the early 1650s by painting large-scale biblical and mythological scenes, but most of his later
        paintings—the ones for which he is most famous—depict scenes of daily life in interior settings. These works are remarkable for
        their purity of light and form, qualities that convey a serene, timeless sense of dignity.
        Vermeer also painted cityscapes and allegorical scenes.</p></center></body>
