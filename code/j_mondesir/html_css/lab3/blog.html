                <h2>On this date</h2>
                <p>Something extraordinary happened.

                    A record became a hit, a new technology was proven to work, someone raised their hand and asked an
                    important question…

                    On this date, someone took a chance, connected, opened a door or showed up with generosity.

                    We can celebrate each of these momentous events today. The best way is by doing it again.</p>

                <h2> Pareto optimality</h2>
                <p>It’s easier to understand than it is to say.

                    The baker and the blacksmith should trade. The baker can make a loaf of bread more easily and
                    efficiently than the blacksmith, and the blacksmith would ruin her productivity if she stopped
                    making rakes and horseshoes in order to put a loaf in the oven.

                    If someone over there can do their particular work efficiently, and you can trade your particular
                    work to them, everyone comes out ahead. It works even if the intermediate step is using cash. Sell
                    your services to one person, use the cash to buy something from someone else.</p>

                <h2>Hustles end badly</h2>
                <p>“They can always say no” is the mantra of someone who is hustling for attention, promo or a sale.

                    But when you hustle a colleague or a friend, they can tell. They can tell that you’re being selfish,
                    angling for a short-term win and trading something precious for something now.

                    When we ask someone to do something for us that we wouldn’t recommend they do for someone else, an
                    important bond is lost.

                    Hustle belongs in hockey.</p>
