        In the original The Legend of Zelda, Hyrule is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon invaded it and stole the
    Triforce of Power. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, Princess Zelda splits it and
    hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is kidnapped by Ganon, she
    commands her nursemaid, Impa, to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old
    woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young swordsman named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing
    Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to
    become powerful enough to defeat Ganon. Link located the eight underground labyrinths, defeats several guardian
    monsters, and retrieves the Triforce fragments. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, Link is able to infiltrate
    Ganon's hideout and defeats him with the Silver Arrow. Link picks up the Triforce of Power from Ganon's ashes and
    returns both pieces of the Triforce to Princess Zelda, restoring peace to Hyrule.
