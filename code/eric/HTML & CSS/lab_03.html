    <p>In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements. Even if we do, the only measure of success that matters is whether
    our solution solves the customer's shifting idea of what their problem is. (Jeff Atwood) But what is it good for?
    (Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the microchip, 1968) The most amazing
    achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by
    the computer hardware industry. (Henry Petroski) There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one
    works. (Alan J. Perlis) There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there
    are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
    (C.A.R. Hoare).</p>

    <p>A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable
    punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions
    based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by
    persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a
    hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place. (IEEE Grid
    newsmagazine) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as
    cleverly as possible, you are-by definition-not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) I don't care if it works on
    your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) It would appear that we have reached the limits of what
    it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to
    sound pretty silly in 5 years. (John Von Neumann, circa 1949)</p>

    <p>There is no programming language-no matter how structured-that will prevent programmers from making bad programs. (Larry
    Flon) The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren't there. (Gordon Bell) Saying that Java is
    nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders. (Alanna) If
    builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy
    civilization. (Gerald Weinberg) Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text
    file. @mattcdowning production.</p>
