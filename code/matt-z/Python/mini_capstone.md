I would like to create a Reddit bot for r/VeteransBenefits that posts helpful information on posts containing content related to suicide or self-harm. I've found a few tutorials that cover the topic that include the use of the Reddit API and a package called praw (Python Reddit API Wrapper). I need to determine how to create credentials for the Reddit API in order to authenticate to the site and make posts. I also need to determine my search criteria and post content. I am going to reach out to the moderator of the subreddit to gain permission for the bot to make posts.
