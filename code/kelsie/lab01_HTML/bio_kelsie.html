<h2><i>Climbing Song</i>
<h3>by Ruby Archer</h3>
Away, away,—to the mountains away,
Where the pine trees murmur and sway,
And the foamy waterfalls sing and spring
Over the boulders gray.

The hidden beauties will lure you on,
'Till your heart from its dreaming is drawn,
And your eyes are bright with the free delight
Known to the fearless fawn.

Fear not to weary—you never can tire,
For the sunshine gives you its fire,
And your feet will follow the breeze with ease,
Higher and ever higher.</pre>
