        parents into a new town (somewhere in Oregon in the movie),
        but she has only complaints to make about this change of home. 
        The house needs to be renovated, the sky is always cloudy, 
        the neighbors are old and eccentric (the only kid around is Wybie Lovat,
        who annoys her) and her parents are so busy with the moving and their
        jobs that Coraline is feeling alone, bored, and unhappy.
    <br>
    <br>
        One night, she discovers a secret door in the house, which leads to another world.
        This place looks exactly like her own, with two differences: 
        everybody has buttons instead of eyes, and overall the apartment is a much better 
         place to live in.
    <br>
    <br>
        Coraline has lots of fun in the other world, despite the warnings of a mysterious cat (who can talk in the magical world) 
        among other characters.
        However, she soon discovers that the Other Mother does not actually love her and wishes to 
        devour her life and trap her soul like she had already done to three other children,
        the Other Father and the other residents of the Other World are in fact her slave creations, 
        and all these amazing things the other world has are just a trick to lure her.
        Eventually, Coraline manages to escape with Other Wybie's assistance 
        (at the cost of his life). However, she discovers the Other Mother has kidnapped her parents.
        So, Coraline asks her if she could participate in a scavenger hunt of the 
        Ghost Children as per the black cat's suggestion to win the deal.
        After realizing that the Other Mother doesn't honor the bargain regardless 
        of whether she wins the game or not, she has the Black Cat help her escape. 
        Once the Beldam is locked out of Coraline's world, Coraline then tosses the key down the well,
        but not without a fight with the Beldam's severed hand.
