                    Guido van Rossum is a Dutch programmer best known as the 
                    creator of the Python programming language, for which he was 
                    the "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL) until he stepped down 
                    from the position on 12 July 2018. He remained a member of the Python
                    Steering Council through 2019, and withdrew from  nominations for the 
                    2020 election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Van Rossum was born and raised in the Netherlands, where he received a
                    master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University
                    of Amsterdam in 1982. He received a bronze medal in 1974 in the
                    International Mathematical Olympiad. He has a brother, Just van
                    Rossum, who is a type designer and programmer who designed the typeface
                    used in the "Python Powered" logo. Van Rossum lives in Belmont,
                    clifornia, with his wife, Kim Knapp, and their son. According to his
                    home page and Dutch naming conventions, the "van" in his name is 
                    capitalized when he is referred to by surname alone, but not when using 
                    his first and last name together. <hrf></hrf>
