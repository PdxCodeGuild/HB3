                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>
                    William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an 
                    American business magnate and philanthropist. He is a 
                    co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood 
                    friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, 
                    Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive 
                    officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, 
                    while also being the largest individual shareholder until 
                    May 2014. He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer 
                    revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.

                    Gates was born and raised in Seattle. In 1975, he and Allen founded 
                    Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest 
                    personal computer software company. Gates led the company as 
                    chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded 
                    by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and 
                    became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized 
                    for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive.
