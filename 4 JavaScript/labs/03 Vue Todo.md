# Vue Todo

Let's make a todo-list with the following features:

- a text input and button to add an item to the list
- a button on each item to mark the item as completed


## Version 2

Use Bootstrap, Materialize, or custom CSS to make it look beautiful.

## Optional
- a button on each item to remove the item
- add completed items to a separate list towards the bottom
