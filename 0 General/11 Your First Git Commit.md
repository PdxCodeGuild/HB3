# Your Fist Git Commit

## Step 1: Clone The Repo

First of all, decide where you want the class repo to be in your computer's filesystem.  This is a personal preference, but it makes sense for it to be somewhere that's relatively quick and easy for you to navigate to in your terminal. 

In my home, `/Users/pete`, I have a `code-guild/` folder.  So, I keep all my class repos in there:
```sh
> pwd # I'm in my home directory
/Users/pete
> cd code-guild
> pwd # now I'm in the code-guild directory
/Users/pete/code-guild
```
Now I'm where I want to be to clone the repo.

### `git clone [repo-url]`
`git clone` will pull down the repo from origin (in this case GitHub).  You can get the repo URL by clicking on the green "Code" button on the main page of the repo.

You can copy that url, or just run this command here:
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/class_koi.git
> # there will be a bunch of output here showing the repo being downloaded...
> # then you can cd into it
> cd class_koi
```

Try `ls` from there if you want to have a look around.

#### Note: do recent changes requiring multi-factor authentication on GitHub, some users might have to run `git clone git@github.com:PdxCodeGuild/class_koi.git` instead.

## Step 2: Make A Branch

Now you're ready to make your own branch.  But first, let's run `git status`:

### `git status`
`git status` is a freebie, a read-only command.  It does not edit or alter anything, it just gives you feedback on the current state of your branch.  Use it as many times as you want to have a good understanding of how git works:

```sh
> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

What that is saying is that you're on the default branch and everything is up to date, but git locally doesn't always have the latest information.  So you will pull down the latest from `origin/main` before making a new branch.  Let's talk about the next two commands before we run them.

### `git pull`
`git pull` pulls down the latest changes for your current branch from GitHub.  Always run `git pull` on the main branch before creating a new branch.

### `git checkout -b [branch-name]`
`git checkout` is a command for switching between different branches.  Given the `-b` flag, it will create a new branch with the given name.  Be sure to **replace `[branch-name]` with the actual name of your branch**.  For this class we will be using certain naming conventions for branches.  For this branch it will be `[your-name]/first-commit`.  

Here's what it would look like for me to create this branch:
```sh
> git pull
> # this will give some feedback, saying whether anything was changed or not
> git checkout -b pete/first-commit # be sure to replace pete with your name
Switched to a new branch 'pete/first-commit'
> git status # you can't run this command too many times
On branch pete/first-commit
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

#### Note: If two or more people have the same name in the class, then this is a good time to discuss how you will differentiate your names.  First name and last initial could work: `pete-j/first-commit`.

Now you've created a branch.  It's time to put something on it.

# Step 3: Create Your Code Folder And Add `.gitkeep`

First of all, `cd` into the `code/` folder:

```sh
> cd code
> pwd # this will be different for everyone, but I can see I'm in the code folder
/Users/pete/code-guild/class_koi/code
```

Now make your personal code folder.  This is where you will be storing your labs.  All the work you do on the repo will be inside your personal folder:

```sh
> mkdir pete # use your name instead
> cd pete # go ahead and cd into the new folder
```

Once again, if you share a name with a classmate, be sure to use something distinct from one another.

#### Note: I recommend going with the all lower-case version of your name, especially if you plan on traversing your file structure with the command line.  However, many modern shells have case-agnostic autocompletion so it may not matter so much.

Let's run `git status` to see if git has recognized your new folder:
```sh
> git status
On branch pete/first-commit
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Git hasn't recognized the new folder.  This is because git keeps track of files, not folders.  It only cares about folders for the files within them.  So we need to add a file to your code folder:

```sh
> pwd # checking where I am
/Users/pete/code-guild/class_koi/code/pete
> touch .gitkeep
> git status
On branch pete/first-commit
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include what will be commited)
        .gitkeep
```

Now that there's a file there, git sees something new.

#### Note: `.gitkeep` is a blank text file used as a placeholder.  It doesn't matter what the file is called, but `.gitkeep` is used as a convention.  It's "keeping" the folder for later.

## Step 4: Add, Commit & Push

### `git add [filepath]`
`git add`, given a filepath, will add that file to version control.  Since the only file you need to add is your `.gitkeep`, you can do this:

```sh
> git add .gitkeep
> git status # let's see what that did!
On branch pete/first-commit
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   .gitkeep
```

#### Note: there are other ways to use `git add`:
`git add .` will add changes in your working directory and everything inside of it. 

`git add -A` will add all changes you've made throughout the repo

Now the file has been added, but more needs to be done.  `git add` is like putting something in an envelope.  It still needs to be sealed and delivered.

### `git commit -m "[your commit message]"`
`git commit` saves a version of your branch in the git history.  The `-m` flag stands for message.  Then, you can put a commit message in quotes.  Every commit must have a message:

```sh
> git commit -m "created code folder"
> # you can say something different for your commit message if you want
> # the idea is to briefly summarize what you did on the commit
> git status # let's see how the status has changed
On branch pete/first-commit
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

#### Note: running `git commit` without the `-m` flag will put you into your default terminal text editor, likely vim.

Now the commit has been added to your local git history.  You have sealed the envelope.  All that's left is to send it away with `git push`.

### `git push`
`git push` uploads your branch and its changes to the repository on GitHub.  From there, anyone else can pull down your work.  When you first create a branch there is nowhere yet to push it to:

```sh
> git push
fatal: The current branch pete/first-commit has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin pete/first-commit
```

So we will do what they say, but there's actually a shortcut for it:

### `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
The `-u` flag is a shorthand for `--set-upstream`.  `origin` is the GitHub repository.  For me, I'd run this command:

```sh
> git push -u origin pete/first-commit
> # you should get some feedback as it uploads your code,
> # including a link to creating a pull request
```

#### Note: you only have to use the `-u` flag the first time you push up to GitHub.  Once your branch exists on GitHub, and you want to push up changes, you can just use `git push`.

Congratulations, you've commited to the repo.  (Check out your profile page, there will be a green square indicating that you pushed up a commit.)  Now all that's left is to make a Pull Request so I can merge your changes into `main`.

## Step 5: Make a Pull Request

If you open up the class repo on GitHub, you should see a notification that you have pushed up changes to a branch recently, with a prompt to create a pull request.  Follow that prompt. And click "Create Pull Request".

#### Note: I will be reviewing and merging all these PRs myself.  For future labs, you will tag the TAs as reviewers to your code.  More on that later.

And that's it!  You've contributed to the repo and made a pull request.  I will review the PRs and merge them into `main`.  By the way, it's a good idea to go back to `main` now.

### `git checkout [branch-name]`
`git checkout` will take you to a different branch.  Go back to main and pull the latest changes down:

```sh
> git checkout main
> git pull
```

Please make a habit of checking out main and pulling the latest changes down often.  You should always pull the latest changes down to main before creating the new branch for each lab.

## Using Git With VS Code:
I recommend everyone learn to do this with the command line.  But you can do absolutely everything here in VS Code's GUI.  You can create folders and files and add, commit, push and pull with VS Code's Source Control tab.  If you're interested, check out their docs here:
